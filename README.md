# DataStructuresWithQueuesAndStacks

**DataStructuresWithQueuesAndStacks** is a C++ project that demonstrates the implementation of various data structures including a doubly linked list, dynamic array, queue, and stack. It features a ticketing system simulation to illustrate operations such as issuing tickets, serving clients, and undo/redo functionality.

## Features

- Doubly Linked List: Implementation and manipulation of a doubly linked list.
- Dynamic Array: Dynamic resizing and manipulation of an array.
- Queue: Queue operations for a ticketing system.
- Stack: Stack operations including push, top, and bottom functions.
- Ticketing System: Simulation of ticket issuance and client service using queues and stacks.

## Installation

Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. Here are some options based on your operating system:

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) for Linux.
- [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) for Windows.

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EngenMe/DataStructuresWithQueuesAndStacks.git
cd DataStructuresWithQueuesAndStacks
```

## Compile the program

```bash
g++ -o DataStructuresWithQueuesAndStacks main.cpp
```

## Usage

Run the program:

```bash
./DataStructures
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the number of questions, difficulty level, and type of arithmetic operations.
